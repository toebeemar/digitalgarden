## Thoughts
  
 The Main Points I take from listening to this book is the
  [[psychological spiral\|"Feedback loop from hell"]] and [[VCR Problems\|VCR Problems]].
 - [[The Backward Law\|The Backward Law]] is when the more you "try" to become Happy or Calm the less you become. (I.E. being anxious about be anxious, feeling guilty about being guilty)
 - You Are Not Special the [[psychological spiral\|loop]] is fueled by societal pressures to be "Happy" and "Positive" all the time. [[_people/Authors/Mark Manson\|Manson]] argues that modern [[consumer culture\|consumer culture]] and [[social media\|social media]] has created generational beliefs that having negative emotions is a personal [[failure\|failure]]. Then it becomes a form of [[self-loathing\|self-loathing]] rooted in the false idea of they you are unique in this "Failure".
 - The Value of [[Suffering\|Suffering]]: Suffering is a necessary and useful part of life. Negative emotions are not to be avoided or suppressed; they are signals that something is wrong and requires action. Embracing suffering and a willingness to struggle for what you believe in is a path to a more meaningful life. 
 - Choosing Your [[Values\|Values]]: good values are those that are reality-based, socially constructive, and within your control. In contrast, "Bad" values are superstitious, socially destructive and uncontrollable. The Quality of Life, according to the book, is determined by the quality of problems you choose to have, which in turn are determined by your values.
 - [[Failure\|Failure]] and [[Rejection\|Rejection]] are key to growth, fear of failure is what holds people back. Growth is an iterative process of being "less wrong" over time. To stand for something, means you must be willing to reject what in not that something. Saying "no" and setting boundaries is an essential part of developing your identity and focusing on what truly matters.
 - The Finality of [[Death\|Death]] The closing remarks of the book urges the reader to contemplate their own mortality. The face is that "you and everyone you know will one day die", that is what gives [[meaning of life\|life it's ultimate meaning]].
