IF YOU ALREADY OWN SOMETHING THAT WORKS YOU DON"T NEED TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING ECO-FRIENDLY DON"T THROW OUT SOMETHING PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL

DONATE WHAT YOU WONT USE TO A THRIFT STORE BE AWARE THEY MAY THROW A LOT OF STUFF AWAY

DON"T BUY WHAT YOU WONT USE

Small mindful changes that add up! You don't have to do them all.
I, myself have not implemented many of these in my life.
